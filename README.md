# UnsupervisedLearning
A few different approaches to unsupervised learning in R (markdown). 

I recently completed a Statistical Learning course taught by Stanford professors Trevor Hastie and Rob Tibshirani through EdX. 
Throughout the course, I applied what I was learning to analyses using R. 
This repo contains a summary of my work on unsupervised learning techniques in R.
